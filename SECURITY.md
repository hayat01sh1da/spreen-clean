## Supported Versions

- Only the latest scripts on `master` are supported.
- Historical tags or forks that diverge from the documented environment may not receive fixes.

## Ecosystem & Compatibility

| Component            | Version(s) / Tooling               | Notes                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS baseline          | WSL (Ubuntu 25.10)                 | Shared environment across tracks.                                                       |
| Ruby CLI utilities   | Ruby 4.0.6 (`.ruby-version`)       | Depend solely on the Ruby standard library; any extra gems must be declared per script. |
| Gemfile              | 4.0.16                             | Per-project dependency manifest; versions install via Bundler.                          |
| Bundler              | 4.0.16                             | Resolves and installs the gems declared in the Gemfile.                                 |
| Python CLI utilities | CPython 3.14.7 (`.python-version`) | Standard-library only. Add new packages via a requirements file if needed.              |

## Backward Compatibility

- Command-line flags and configuration prompts remain stable across Ruby 4.0.x and Python 3.14.x releases. If a migration is required, the README will include step-by-step guidance.
- Scripts are not tested on older interpreter majors, and we do not backport security fixes to them.
